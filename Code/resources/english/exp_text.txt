instructions_1: >
    You are participating in an experiment in which you can earn
    different amounts of money. The amount you earn depends on the
    decisions you make. It is therefore very important that you read
    these instructions carefully.
    
    
    Click 'Weiter' when you are ready.

    
instructions_2: >
    The experiment has different sections in which you earn points.
    After each section you will see how many points you earned.
    At the end of the experiment, one of these sections will be
    selected randomly and the points you earned in the selected
    section will be converted into Euros. The resulting amount
    will be paid to you in cash.    
    
    
    {} points = 1 Euro

    
instructions_3: >
    You will be paired with another participant throughout the experiment.
    We will refer to the other participant as Person B. Your identity and
    Person B's will be kept anonymous.
    
    
    In each section, you will go through several rounds making decisions.
    In each round, you will start with 20 points.
    In each round, your task is to decide how to divide these points.
    You must decide how many points you will 
    contribute to a project and how many points you will keep for yourself.

    
instructions_4: >
    In each round, your income is determined by the amount you kept
    for yourself and the income you received from the project:

    
    Income from round = points kept + income from project

    
    Your income from the project depends on your contribution
    and Person B's contribution. The total amount contributed
    to the project is multiplied by 1.8 and then distributed
    evenly between you and Person B.
    
    
    For example, if you contribute 10 points and Person B contributes 
    10 points, the total amount contributed to the project is 20.
    This amount is then multiplied by 1.8 resulting in 36 points
    (almost doubled). These 36 points are then distributed evenly
    between you and Person B, so each receives 18 points.

    
    Your income for this round is 28, because you kept 10 points
    and made 18 points from the project.
    
    
instructions_5: >
    The income from each round is added to your account, where it is 
    saved until the end of the section. Each round you start with a
    new set of 20 points to allocate.
    
    
    See the following visual explanation of how the income is calculated
    for you and Person B.
    
    
instructions_6: >
    This formula summarizes how your income is calculated in each round. 
    Person B read the same instructions as you did, and earns points in the same way.
    
    
control_q_1: >
    Feel free to ask the experimenter for paper and pencil to do calculations.
    
    
    Imagine that your contribution is 0 and Person B's contribution is also 0.
    $$
    How many points do you earn?
    $$
    How many points does Person B earn?
    
    
control_q_2: >
    Feel free to ask the experimenter for paper and pencil to do calculations.
    
    
    Imagine that your contribution is 20 and Person B's contribution is also 20.
    $$
    How many points do you earn?
    $$
    How many points does Person B earn?
    
    
control_q_3: >
    Feel free to ask the experimenter for paper and pencil to do calculations.
    
    
    Imagine that your contribution is 10.
    How many points do you earn if...
    $$
    Person B's contribution is 0?
    $$
    Person B's contribution is 10?
    $$
    Person B's contribution is 20?
    
    
control_q_wrong: >
    One or more of your answers was incorrect. Please try again.    

    
summary_0: >
    Here you see an example of the screen which you will later use to
    choose your contribution to the project. You can change
    your contribution until you press the 'Weiter' button.

    
summary_1: >
    At the end of each period you will receive a summary of the
    contributions and payoffs of each person for that period.
    Here you see an example of the summary screen.
    
    
    When you press the 'Weiter' button, the following round begins.
    If you do not press 'Weiter, the next round will start after 30 seconds.
    
    
    We will clarify the components of the summary 
    screen point-by-point.

    
summary_2: >
    One column shows the contributions to the project,
    the other column shows the payoffs.


summary_3: >
    The middle column indicates whether contributions and payoffs
    are yours or Person B's. Below Person B's information, you will find
    the sums and averages of contributions and payoffs for the round.


summary_4: >
    Here is a concrete example: Imagine that you have contributed 10 points 
    and Person B has contributed 10 points to the project.

    
summary_5: >
    The sum of the contributions is therefore 20 (10 + 10)
    and the average is 10 (20 divided by 2).

    
summary_6: >
    Your payoff is:
    
    
    
    
    
    You made 28 points in this round.

    
summary_7: >
    Person B's payoff is:

    
    
    
    
    Person B made 28 points in this round.
    
    
summary_8: >
    On this side we show you the sum of the payoffs:
    28 + 28 = 56, as well as the average payoff: 56 divided by 2 = 28.

    
pre_calibration_instructions: >
    If you have questions, please ask the experimenter!
    
    
    Otherwise, click 'Weiter' and after calibrating the eye tracker,
    you will begin the experiment.

    
detect_pupils_screen: >
    Sit comfortably and move your head into a position where
    you see your eyes projected in the middle of the screen.
    Let the 'Weiter' button activate by setting our eyes within
    the green region for a few seconds. Then press the button.
